# Clippings Gateway

Work-in-progress tool for uploading a Kindle's My Clippings.txt file to Clippings.io.

## Current progress

The tool works for retrieving a JWT from Clippings and the file is POSTed successfully, but the new highlights never actually appear in the Clippings.io service. There appears to be some realtime stuff happening in the backend that might need to be reverse-engineered as well.
